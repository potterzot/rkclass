Description: rkclass is a package that implements instrumental variables regression methods. These
  are commonly known as two-stage least squares, limited-information maximum likelihood, and Fuller.
  Each of these are special examples of K-class estimators, of which standard OLS is also a member.
  rkclass can be used to calculate instrumental variables estimates as well as test for weak
  instruments, over-identification, etc...
