Instrumental variables regressions are often used in causal inference of the type discussed in Angrist and Pischke's [Mostly Harmless Econometrics](http://www.mostlyharmlesseconometrics.com/) and [Mastering 'Metrics](http://masteringmetrics.com/).\r\n\r\nMy initial interest in instrumental variables regression began while I was working as a research assistant at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) on the [Moving to Opportunity](http://www.nber.org/mtopublic/) project. I was given the task of trying to implement bekker-adjusted standard errors for some of the coefficients. Pursuit of this led me into the depths of Stata's Mata programming and obscure help files detailing the calculation of robust standard errors under clustering. Days later when I resurfaced I had very nearly, but not quite, been able to at least replicate the results we obtained using `ivreg2`. Years later, I find myself unable to shake the bug that I never was able to complete, and hence this package was born.\r\n\r\n###Installation\r\n\r\nFor now `rkclass` is not on CRAN. You can instead install it via github:\r\n\r\n    library(devtools)\r\n    devtools::install_github(\"potterzot/rkclass\")\r\n\r\n###Contributing\r\n\r\nThis package needs substantial work to be as fully functioning as `ivreg2` in Stata is, and all contributions are warmly welcome! There are a few great ways that you could contribute:\r\n\r\n* If you don't know something, please let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/potterzot/rkclass/issues/new) or sending me an email. This will help make me aware of problems, things that need more explanation, etc...\r\n* Feature requests. If there is something you'd really like to see added that isn't, and you don't feel up to the task of adding it yourself, please open and issue and request a feature. I'd like to create a roadmap of features to add.\r\n* If you spot some errors, you can either [open an issue](https://github.com/potterzot/rkclass/issues/new) or edit the file directly and then submit a [pull request](https://github.com/potterzot/rkclass/compare/). There is a very short [contributing guide](https://github.com/potterzot/rkclass/CONTRIBUTING.md) on style.\r\n* If you [submit a pull request](https://github.com/potterzot/rkclass/compare/) with substantive code updates (which would be AWESOME!), please do your best to follow a similar [coding style](https://github.com/potterzot/rkclass/CONTRIBUTING.md), document new functions, etc... I'm happy to help provide some suggestions if needed.\r\n\r\n###Use\r\n\r\n*Be warned that `rkclass` is still under development. The results for standard regressions should be correct (and are tested against `AER::ivreg`, but other methods may not be available and function calls may change.*\r\n\r\nIf instrumental variables regressions (2SLS, LIML, FULLER) include many instruments, the standard errors can be incorrect. Hansen, Hausman, and Newey [1] generalized Bekker's [2] standard error adjustments for use in multiple situations other than just LIML.\r\n\r\nUse syntax follows the syntax from `AER::ivreg`, which looks like `kclass(formula, data, ...)`. The returned result is a model object that has many (hopefully all) of the associated methods, including `summary`, `print`, etc... For more usage examples see the getting started vignette by typing `vignette('kclass-intro')`. For a more in depth look, see `vignette('AngristKrueger1991')`, which provides a replication of some of the results of that paper.\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgements\r\nMany resources were helpful in the development of `rkclass`.
